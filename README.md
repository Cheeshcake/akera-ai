# Few Notes:

## Why I chose headless cms instead of traditional cms:
headless cms allows me to have freedom over the frontend meaning I can choose whichever framework to work with (in this case astro and tailwind)so there is no use of working with traditional cms for this project.

The choice of the cms option was the hardest step, so what I did was checking the astro documentations and then I joined the Astro discord server to base my decision off of people's experiences and I learned quite few things.
Lots of cms options were presented to me such as strapi, contentful, netlifyCMS, directus...
The ones I tried out in a simple blog themed astro project were strapi, sanity.io, netlifyCMS... then finally someone in discord suggested TinaCMS so I tried it out.

## Why I chose TinaCMS:
-contentful required money as the project grows
-directus is not fully free (5-10$ monthly)
Every option had its limitation and the main limitation of tinaCMS as I heard from the community is that it sometimes requires the use of react which I have no problem with.
Furthermore, tinaCMS is perfectly documented on Astro docs and on its own website, it offers the option to create a good integration with Astro. And since it was very popular in the astro community I decided to give it a try.
